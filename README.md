# Maze Solver
This is a school project which solves a 10 x 10 maze from entry to exit using breadth-first search (queue) and depth-first search (stack)

PLEASE NOTE THE MAZE MUST BE ONE ENTRY PER LINE, AND
THE MAZE MUST BE IN THE SAME ABSOLUTE DIRECTORY AS MazeSolver.py

Any questions? Feel free to make a pull request and ask.
